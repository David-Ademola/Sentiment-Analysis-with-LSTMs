Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as a review or comment. This project aims to automatically classify the sentiment of product reviews as either positive or negative using deep learning techniques.

## Features

- Preprocesses text data to remove noise and standardize input.
- Utilizes an LSTM neural network for sentiment classification.
- Provides a console app for easy sentiment analysis of user-inputted text.
- Includes model training and evaluation scripts for customization and further development.
